4K-AutoZoom sets the zoom level of a tab on a 4K screen. 200% if it was maximized to full screen 4K, 100% if it was sized back to a FHD window (or smaller).

This extension is a life-saver for people who use 4K screens with 4 FHD windows and occasionally need to maximize a window to read/see stuff in detail.

Shortcut:
CTRL + UP: Toogle zoom level between 100% and 200%.

This extension works in conjunction with the extension "Zoom Per Tab" by kthxbye.
